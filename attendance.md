Attendance2 [iTunes App Store link](http://appstore.com/attendance2) is an app designed for teachers to take attendance in the classroom (either manually or by scanning QR or bar codes). It has options for generating random groups of students or selecting students in random order. You may customize the status from the default values of Absent, Present, Late, Excused and may use an optional second set of status values (for recording participation or other options).

Attendance2 is a complete rewrite of the original Attendance app that I developed for iOS 2.0. It is designed to be more general and more customizable. Each course/group is a separate data file so it can be shared with teaching assistants and/or school administrators who also have the Attendance2 app (i.e., a school administrator could collect data files from each of his/her teachers on his/her iOS device). Attendance2 is a universal iOS (iPhone/Touch and iPad) app. Version 3.9 and earlier of Attendance2 will run on versions iOS 5, 6, and 7. Version 4.0 of Attendance2 require iOS 7.1 or higher.  Version 5.0 and higher of Attendance2 require iOS 8 or newer to support the new Dropbox API. Version 6.0 and higher of Attendance2 require iOS 9.

Attendance2 cannot import the attendance records from the original Attendance app since the internal data structures are completely different; however, you can export the names as a CSV file (using the Info Report on the report tab of the original Attendance app) and import that CSV file into the new app. If you were using the original app, it probably makes sense to start using the new Attendance2 app at the beginning of a new term/semester.

The videos (links below) were made with an earlier version of iOS (except of the three CSV videos made with iOS 11) but the app has been updated to work with newer versions and the look and feel of the UI matches the look and feel of the newer versions of iOS.

Here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC2fEIhzGPw&list=UUXW1Oq177yGUsO1MbPySUGQ) to a longer video made by a music teacher who used Word/Excel and their mail merge feature to print out nice folder labels with the QR codes generated by the app. You don't need to go to all this trouble to use QR codes (as the app will even assign unique ID numbers and generate the QR codes for you), but if you want to include other information and print the QR codes, this is a well-done video showing detailed steps to do it.

Since I make about $2 a copy after Apple's 30% cut and taxes, a handful of people have asked how they can pay me for answering support emails. Here is a [Pay Pal donate option](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RN5TX5LDXUDWJ) that you can use if I have answered a support email for you and you would like to thank me.
