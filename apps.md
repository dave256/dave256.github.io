Since I teach computer science I write apps I want to use and hope that others find useful. 

### Attendance2

[App Store link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/attendance2/id536206472?mt=8)
An iPhone/iPad attendance app designed for use in the classroom but general enough that some people use it for other attendance taking situations. There's more information about the site on my website [dave256apps.com/Attendance2](http://www.dave256apps.com/attendance2/).

### reDraw Whiteboard

[App Store link](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/redraw/id1114820588?mt=8)
An iPad whiteboard drawing app with full support for the Apple Pencil. You can pre-create presentations with it and then step through them or you can use it in real-time in a classroom or note-taking setting. It also supports recording the presentation directly on the iPad and saving the video file to share with others. More information on my website [dave256apps.com/redraw/](http://www.dave256apps.com/redraw/)

### GradeA

[Mac App Store link](http://appstore.com/mac/gradea)
